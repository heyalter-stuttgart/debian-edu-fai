          -> ITZKS}: Directly connecting to faiserver.intern is

        * scripts/ITZKS/30-disable-nscd-netgroups-cache: No need to disable

          comment. Needs more investigation. (218c12e)
        * scripts/EDU/98-drop-fai-aptproxy: Drop script. It is actually quite
          recommendable keeping the FAI proxy (it might be optimized
          for APT package downloading). (2761d84)
        * scripts/EDU/50-cups-browsing: Adapted to Debian Edu 11, modify
          cups-browsed-debian-edu.conf instead of cups-browsed.conf.
