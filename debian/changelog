debian-edu-fai (2023.09.09.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Guido Berhoerster ]
  * Fix nullmailer configuration
    Configure the nullmailer relayhost (the default is mail.<domain>) in order to
    allow clients to actually send mail and explicitly set /etc/mailname
    (Closes: #1051461).
  * Do not append the hostname to /etc/mailname
    Do not append to /etc/mailname, the file should contain a single hostname.
    Rather create it with the default "postoffice.intern" if it does not exist yet.
    This is consistent with manual installations of Debian Edu.

debian-edu-fai (2023.09.07.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Debian Edu FAI for Debian bookworm.

  [ Guido Berhoerster ]
  * Rename bin/debian-edu-faiinstall to bin/debian-edu-fai_install for
    consistency with debian-edu-router.
  * Actually install /etc/security/group.conf on bullseye. From bookworm on this
    is handled via cfengine.
  * Use non-free-firmware component on bookworm and later.
    This is required for installing the firmware packages.
  * Add support for memtest86+ x64.
  * debian/control: Add explicit dependency on memtest86+.
  * Unset TMPDIR when invoking fai-make-nfsroot.
    On a DebianEdu installation pam_tmpdir is installed which sets TMPDIR to
    /tmp/user/<uid>.  This is then propagated from fai-make-nfsroot to
    debootstrap which causes maintainer scripts making use of TMPDIR (e.g. by
    calling mktemp) to fail because the directory does not exist inside the
    chroot.
  * Add some documentation about NFS exports to README.md
  * Switch to installing bookworm.
  * Ensure parent of target directory exists before copying FAI config space
    debian-edu-faiinstall does not check whether the parent of the target
    directory /srv/fai/config existed before invoking cp -a on the config space.
    Thus, if /srv/fai does no exist cp will copy /usr/share/debian-edu-fai/fai
    /config to /srv/fai instead of /srv/fai/config which is not detected until
    booting a client via PXE.  Fix this by ensuring the parent directory of
    $FAI_CONFIGDIR_REAL exists.
    Additionally do not hardcode /srv/fai which ignores that FAI_CONFIGDIR is
    configurable.
  * Disable apt proxy by default. Do not assume faiserver.intern exists. The
    proxy can be set via /etc/debian-edu/debian-edu-fai.conf.
  * Fix instructions in README.md and /etc/debian-edu/debian-edu-fai.conf
    The configuration file name is /etc/debian-edu/debian-edu-fai.conf not
    /etc/debian-edu/faiinstall.conf.
    Improve and shorten the instructions to set up SSH access for the fai user.
  * Add primary group fai for the fai user (instead of primary group
    nobody).
  * Recommend the use of yescrypt password hashes.
    This follows the default since Debian bullseye.
  * Add note about syntax to configuration.
  * Update motd for bookworm.
  * README.md: Change instructions to emphasize the need for first time
    configuration. Users should not be enticed to blindly run
    debian-edu-fai_install before actually configuring the server.
  * Ensure debian-edu-fai.conf is not world-readable
    It contains password hashes for the root account of installed clients so
    like /etc/shadow it should not be world readable.
  * Replace fetch-ldap-cert script usage with fetch-rootca-cert
    The fetch-ldap-cert init script has been obsolete and was removed
    (see #971780).
