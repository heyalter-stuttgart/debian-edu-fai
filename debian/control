Description: FAI config space for setting up Debian Edu workstations
 The Debian Edu project provides Debian based systems customized for
 schools and other education facilities.
 .
 This package provides an installation method for Debian Edu workstations
 based on FAI (Fully Automated Installation).
 .
 Other than the Debian Installer based installation of Debian Edu
 workstations (provided by debian-edu-config), the FAI method is more
 flexible and customizable.
